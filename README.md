# Perry the Pear Programmer

## What is Perry?

Perry the Pear Programmer is a VS Code extension that helps programmers learn and improve their coding skills by providing guidance without writing code for them.

Unlike other AI coding assistants that generate complete solutions, Perry focuses on explaining concepts, suggesting approaches, and providing helpful tips - but never actual code. This approach helps you develop your own problem-solving skills and truly understand what you're building.

## How It Works

Perry connects to AI services (OpenAI) through a Python backend. When you ask a question, Perry:

1. Analyzes your current code and project context
2. Sends this information to the AI service
3. Filters out any code blocks from the AI's response
4. Presents you with helpful guidance and explanations

By deliberately avoiding code generation, Perry encourages you to write the solution yourself, leading to better learning and retention.
